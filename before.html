    <h1> Colon Cancer Information</h1>
    <p> I have decided to focus on colon cancer rates because it is something that is important to me since it has diretly impacted my fmaily. Colon cancer is one of the most preventabe cancers out there, but screening does not happen until you are 50 years old. More and more young adults however, have been being dignaosed with later stage colon cancer. My cause is the thought that the screening age needs to be lowered, and theoritcally, the rates should drop as well. My dad was 35 when he died of stage four colon cancer, and we have had no history of it or other cancers in my family- if the screening age had been lowered, he may be alive today, or at least had better odds to fight.I find the research fascinating on how the rates have changed. </p>
