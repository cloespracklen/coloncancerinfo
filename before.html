    <h1> Colon Cancer Information</h1>
    <p> I have decided to focus on colon cancer rates throughout the regions in the United States of America. I have decided to go with this research because I find it very interesting and important to me becuase my Dad died of stage four colon cancer when I was 14. I think that the lack of health care coverage throughout the United States really does go hand in hand with the rates of colon cancer, and we will see this throughout my research. My cause is that the lack of healthcare in some regions of the United States does lead to higher incidence and mortality rates of colon cancer.
